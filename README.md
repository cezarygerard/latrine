# Latrine
The purpose is to easier documentation anything you would like flush with water and you're forced to live with it for a while.

## Idea
The project's idea was born in a head of one of my colleagues during hacking on shitty library
to remove some of its features that prevented an application to bootstrap properly.

He marked the code with shitty shit comment and explanation. After few more plumbing works team
decided to improve on marking such code by usage of @ShittyShit annotation.

## Usage
If you're about to use this annotation, I feel sorry for you. Nevertheless please do not hesitate yourself to apply it to shitty code, which purpose to pull you out of the deep shit you're in.

Just remember to provide explanation, otherwise he might think that you dragged him into a deep shit.
